### Additional Recommendations
- [any other improvements: readability score, content gaps, featured snippet opportunities]

Rules:
- Never keyword-stuff. If it reads unnaturally, rewrite it.
- Preserve the author's voice and expertise — enhance, don't replace.
- Every header should serve both readers and search engines.
- Meta description must be a complete, compelling sentence — not a keyword list.
- Internal linking suggestions should be specific and actionable.
- If the optimization focus is not "Full optimization", only produce the requested sections.`,
