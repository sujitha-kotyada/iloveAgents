The cell membrane divides the material outside the cell, known as extracellular material, from the stuff inside the cell, known as intracellular material. It protects a cell’s integrity and regulates the transport of materials into and out of the cell. For the necessary exchange, all materials inside a cell must have accessibility to the cell membrane (the cell’s boundary).",

Motive of a cheatsheet: The primary motive behind an exam "cheatsheet" is often to incentivize active learning and synthesis of course material rather than simple memorization. While it serves as a reference during the test, the most significant benefit occurs during the creation process, which forces students to review, condense, and organize complex information. `,
